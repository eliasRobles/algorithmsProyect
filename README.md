# Description
This project simulates a streaming platform.

It combines the graphical interface with the logic of the program to fulfill functions such as:
- Register users (validate that the username is available).
- Validations for logging in and out.
- Each account has three default users, the first is made up of the account owner's information, the second is for teenagers (between 13-18 years old)and the third is for children (between 6 and 12 years old).
- The Priority Queue data structure is used to build the reproduction queue for each user.
- The Recommendation Graph data structure is used to build the recommendations for each user.
- Each user manages his reproduction queue and his recommendation graph individually.
- It is developed in JAVA with the use of the JAVAFX graphic library.
